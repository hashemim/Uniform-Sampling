# Uniform-Sampling
Uniform random sampling of U(n)

The code provides a uniform random sample of U(n) group. These are n \times square unitary matrices. 
We also test the the uniformity for U(2) using the Bloch sphere. 

The code is an implementation of the essay by Maris Ozlos titled " How to generate a random unitary matrix, which is accessible at
